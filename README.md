# Spark-Projects
Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for big data processing, with built-in modules for streaming, SQL, machine learning and graph processing. It allows the programmers to write complex multi-stage data pipelines with the help of the Directed Acyclic Graphs. The DAGS scheduler working under the hood, alogn with the Spark's powerful In-memory processing allows it to be 100x faster than MapReduce(10x for onDisk uses). With Scala, we can exploit its powerful distibuted features and do unimaginable things. 

This repository will contain all the Spark Driver Programs of the projects that I attempt to complete as I keep learning new stuff. I will be covering components like Spark Streaming for processing real-time data processing, MLLib for distributed Machine Learning, and other spark components like SparkSQL and GraphX as I keep progressing.

I will also be including a document explaining how to Deploy a Spark Driver program over the AWS Cloud Infrastructure to utilize it distribute power. I will the deployment over services like S3(Simple Storage Service) Distribute Storage, EMR ( Elastic Map Reduce) cluseters, and EC2 Computing Instances.

I would highly appreciate if anyone would like to contribute to my initiative. Constructive criticism is also very much welcome.
